# Technology Detection

The Technology Detection add-on uses various patterns and finger prints to detect the technologies used by applications.

It works in a very similar way to the Wappalyzer browser add-ons with the following exceptions:

* It does not use the 'Global JavaScript variables' as these are difficult to test without a 'full' browser
* It does not not show the confidence - this is still todo
* It does not match technologies on the basis of DOM properties as some properties are set by JavaScript in the browser after the response has passed through ZAP
* It allows you to see the 'evidence' used to detect the technologies

## The Technology Tab

This tab shows all of the detected technologies for the site selected.  
Right clicking on a technology will display a 'Show evidence' menu under which are all of the regexes used to detect it.  
Selecting a regex will switch to the 'Search' tab and search through the history for that regex. Note: If multiple rows are selected the menu will not be displayed.

Beside the site selection drop down is an Export button which can be used to export a CSV (comma separated values) file based on the
table information currently being displayed. There is also a toggle button which allows users to easily Enable/Disable the Technology Detection
passive scanner.

The toolbar includes an enable/disable toggle button which controls whether the technology detection passive scan rule is functioning or not.
This enabled state is persisted between ZAP sessions.

## Reporting

Technology data is available to reports via the [WappalyzerJobResultData](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/tree/main/addOns/wappalyzer/src/main/java/org/zaproxy/zap/extension/wappalyzer/automation/WappalyzerJobResultData.java) class.
